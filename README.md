How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?
3,497,390 trips over the month of July 2022

By what percentage has total ridershop grown?

Trending upwars with a ~15% increase (need to work on that one to get a real number out of it)

How as the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?

What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?

Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are top locations?)

Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)

Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?)

Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)

Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?

How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the timespan?

How does the average trip duration change by age?

What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?

Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inpsection in the timespan?

How variable is the utilization by bike ID?



Observations:

Counts of rides are increaseing between january and june of 2022
rides from members are increasing faster than casual rides, indicating an increaase in membership over the time frame (since we would expect more rides in summer, if membership was staying the same we would see these ratios roughly equivelent)

density of ending locations are more spread out (this makes sense as people are moving away from their starting locations. Also our staring locations are limited to New York City)

graph showing ridership counts over the hours in a day show that rides are more popular in the afternoon
members have a sharp uptick at 8am and 5pm indicating that members are using the bikes to comute to work
casual shows a slow rise throughout the day reaching its peak at 5pm 
ending times show a very similar slope (indicating that rides are short where both the start and end reside in the same hour)

further proof of our conclusion that membership is driven by commuters is this graph showing the counts over the course of the week. Members rise throught the week peaking on Wednesday and dropping off on weekends, while casual ridership is the opposite, peaking on the weekends and falling during the week 

rides from classic bikes show a peference

members don't use docked bikes at all

casual riders perfered electric bikes in the jannuary



Unexpected Phenomena 1 - Memebers appear to be commuters,
2 graphs, comparing showing two lines each comparing rides started by members and casuals broken down by hour and by weekday showing that members have an uptick at 8am and 5pm, and during weekdays. Casuals tending towards afternoon (peaking alongside memebers around 5pm) and weekends

Casual users tend to take longer trips, with a median trip length of 15 minutes
Members tned to take short trips with a median length of 9 minutes

nearly 220 million minutes of travel from nearly 13 million trips
median length of trips increases from january to june (likely people taking longer rides durring the spring and summer)
Causal users take shorter trips in the in the morning between 5 and 6 am rising steadily thoughout the day, reaching its peak in the early afternoon around 2-3 pm
Member riders dip in the morning hours and plateau over the course of the day, with only a small uptick at 5-6pm (meaning that members tend to ride for around the same amount of time throughout the day indicating a larger number of small trips,
casual users however prefer longer bike rides during the early afternoon (possibly riding for leisure?)

trip times are longer during the weekends (leisure trips?) this is more dramatic for casual users, more evidence for my conclusion that casual users are riding for pleasure

## Deeper dive into the most popular sites to start a trip from bothe members and casuals ##

central park S and 6 ave for casuals with 21 thousand rides in the time period with a fifth of those riders returning to the same location

w 21 st and 6 ave for members
take it to 9 ave and w 22nt street (these are used almost exclusively by members)


2 graph comparing the average time and distance of trips taken by memebers and casuals over a plot of time broken down by weekday and by hour (haven't figured out how to do this yet. this would show the average commute distance for rides started around 8am and 5pm. for rides taken one the weekends maybe higher distance? leisure rides?)
answers the question if members or casuals take longer rides, or cover longer distances) (don't quite know who to gauge distances though)

Unexpected Phenomena 2 - maybe differences in types of bikes? Are electric bikes perfered more by members? do they travel a further distance? or travel for longer? Do people like to use them on weekends or weekdays, during commute hours or not?


Need 2 dashboards to demostrate these two phenomena

final map showing bike staitions with an indication of popular locations, idealy dynamic showing the change with month, and with zip code boundries overlaid on the map

create a tableau story that brings together the visualizations, maps and dapboards
