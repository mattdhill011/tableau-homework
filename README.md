Taking ride data from CitiBike from between January 2022 and June 2022, I take a look at the difference in riding habits between members and casual riders.

Members appear to be mostly commuters, taking shorter trips (both in distance and in time) during weekdays, especially during rush hour. They tend to start their trips in residential areas and end them across the ciry. While riding they cover more distance in shorter time than their casual counterparts. 

Casual riders, on the other hand, take trips in the early afternoon and on weekends. Compared to members their trips tend to be longer and often return to the station that they started at. It is likely that most casual riders are tourists, taking the bikes on the weekends for leisurely rides around the cities parks.
